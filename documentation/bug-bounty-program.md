# Bug Bounty Program

The xBacked protocol will under go an audit prior to launching on main net. This does not guarantee a flawless protocol, and if you have found a vulnerability, please discretely contact the development team, [@xbacked](https://twitter.com/xbacked) on twitter via DM or discord mods.

We will ensure those who disclose vulnerabilities to us are compensated well, because protecting users' funds is critical to our mission and maintaining trust within the ecosystem.&#x20;
