# Token Distribution

There are 100 million governance tokens, allocated as follows.

{% hint style="warning" %}
This is subject to change prior to TGE. For example, we may decide an IDO is not a strategic way to distribute tokens.
{% endhint %}

| ----------------------------- | ---------- |
| Community, Marketing & Growth | 53%        |
| Team                          | 20%        |
| 1st Seed Round                | 10%        |
| Pre-seed Allocation           | 5%         |
| 2nd Seed Round (potential)    | 5%         |
